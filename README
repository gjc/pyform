v0.9

Implementation of a Python interface to the
computer algebra system Form.

form.py was started by Thomas Reiter and
developed by Gavin Cullen

This module contains a class for communication with a
FORM process through its external channels.

For it to work you need the .txt file 
'template.frm' kicking around. This allows one to set up the form process.
In general how it works is that for every command a simple form process is setup.
However, it can easily be extended to set up more complicated Form processes
and run them in python.
